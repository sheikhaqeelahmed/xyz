python class 1:

jupyter notebook
jupyter lab

python read coding line by line

conda --version
anaconda-navigator  (if global tick mark not done)


new
python3


shift + enter (to execute current cell and add new line)
or
ctrl + enter (to execute current cell but not add new line)

every function has a signature or it's also called doc string
use shift + tab to check docstring

escape characters e.g \n, \t, \tt etc

variables
reserve words/key words
division is by default float (if we divide the result would be float)
use // instead of / for division if we need answer without decimal

round((10/3),3)

print('apple' * 5)

type(a)   ===> to check data type

Concatination

age=input('What is your age? ')
name=input'What is your name? ')
print('My name is ' + name + ' and age is ' + age)

input is by default string

type casting
when we define data type ourselves to a variable then it's called type casting

age = int(input('What is your age? '))
print('My name is ' + name + ' and age is ' + str(age))

We can also use , instead of + but it's not ok with the programming

{} is called place holder
.format is a method

print('My name is {} and my age is {} '.format(name,age))

print('My name is {name} and my age is {age} '.format(name,age))

print('My name is {0} and my age is {1} '.format(name,age))
